## Description
The Game is a platformer that features parkour style wall jumping, slides and dives. It is centred on a Ninja trying to deliver pizza within a time limit. The Gurani (granny) clan has placed assassins in the ninja's path that will try and take him out with evil pizza, also birds will try and take him out with evil pizza. Also police can finish him off. It's only a matter of time whether this Ninja Pizza hero can deliver all of the pizzas. The game is set over two tutorials and three levels totalling five levels. The first two will teach the player the jumping mechanics needed for the game, the last three pitch our hero against fiendish old woman, malevolent birds, deadly drops and lethal lava. Someone must be pizzaâ€™s hero, and this ninja has stepped up to the plate.
